# IABCodeEngine
 IAB code migration engine: create a Web page with two boxes and a button in the middle of them. The left box is an input box where the developer pastes the source code of it’s Android App with Google IAB “calls”. After pressing the button, the engine inserts the OpenIAB code in the right box. He then can copy that code to their IDE.
